            <h3>From Print Magazine</h3>
            <div class="article-content">
              <p>
                Working with this diverse team of seniors and juniors has been the greatest joy-ride. When we first
                started this journey, we weren't sure where to begin.
                We had so many questions like, “How do we make a magazine? Who do we talk to? Do you think the Times
                will answer us?” One of the few things we
                did know was our theme, Home. We recently moved into our new campus, which was the high-light of our
                semester. While we loved the feeling of
                the new campus combined with the fresh air and drinkable water, there were many aspects we missed from
                the old building. With this big move
                from our original home to our new home, we dug deeper into what home actually means to each of us. On
                the cover, you notice the planet Earth
                takes the form of a human heart, which symbolizes the prominent phrase “Home is where the heart is.” The
                world, the continent, the country,
                the state, the city, all correspond to our meaning of home; however, with-in each contains a different
                story that composes who we are as individuals.
                To me, home is where the aroma of freshly rolled flour tortillas and bean tacos in a brown paper bag
                fill the air. It's where I can hide away
                from anything and every-thing, and where the background noises are constantly filled with my siblings
                playing some kind of made-up game or
                my mom playing Tejano classics. While this is my version of home, The Storybook, is a representation of
                our members through viewpoints in
                art and literature. We hope you enjoy this inaugural edition!</p>

            <h3>Lee Ann Fincher</h3>
            <div class="article-content">
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What defines Jackson Tennessee? Is it a college town housing Lane, Lambuth, and
                Union; is it found in the rhythm of Rockabilly music, or in the faces of the 67,000 people who
                call Jackson TN home? For Sandy Fincher, Jackson has been home since 1981 when she first
                arrived in town to attend Union University. For her, Union, and soon the city of Jackson was
                a place to “thrive but wasn't too big to be lost.” Nestled between Nashville and Memphis TN,
                Jackson was the perfect place to have access to city life without the expense of city living and
                became a place where Mrs. Fincher felt safe. For 40 years she has watched the city grow into
                bigger and better things.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; “Over the years, I have seen many things change here. The town has grown in many
                ways; an industry explosion in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought people from all over the
                United States to Jackson.” Prior to this, Jackson had limited industry, but this change introduced
                companies that produced electric wires, paint guns, and air compressors. “The opportunities were
                endless” with industry from Procter and Gamble, Delta Faucet Company, Pinnacle Foods, and more.
                Healthcare and education in Jackson TN would be changing, and West
                Tennessee Healthcare would become the largest employer in the city. The growth of healthcare
                and education services helped Jackson to change from just a manufacturing-based economy
                into a community with a large service-centered economy.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Another economic boom has been in locally owned businesses. “It is so great to see locals
                honored in their businesses where they use their intellect and knowledge to display what
                they produce along with their talents.” Mrs. Fincher expressed this when discussing such businesses as
                the Farmers' Market, Turntable Coffee, Dixie Castle, Light Trap Books, and the multiple local boutiques.
                Downtown Jackson has welcomed a wide range of locally owned eateries,
                boutiques, cafes, and salons. While Jackson had once been filled with locally owned stores
                downtown, the creation of the Old Hickory Mall shifted the business away from downtown.
                For many years, these buildings were empty. It is exciting to see such growth and the variety
                of stores putting down new roots in this area. The Jackson community preserves the feeling of
                being “local” through their love and admiration for these business owners.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Education in Jackson has changed drastically in the last four decades. “Shortly before I
                came to Jackson, the county schools and city schools merged into one school district.” This
                made many smaller county schools close and forced the students to move into city schools,
                significantly changing the student body. The school system worked to maintain a balanced
                diverse student body by requiring each school to follow a 50/50 balance between majorities
                and minorities. “This caused a lot of stress on all parents in the school system because children
                were constantly being moved, or redistricting, to a different school.” Some families moved into
                surrounding counties.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jackson-Madison County school system would grow into a place catering to wide
                interest. “We have high schools that are as diverse as the students who attend them.” South
                Side High School is known for its vocational classes and theater programs while Liberty High
                School has an incredible ROTC program along with agricultural classes. Early College High
                allows you to earn your associate degree at the same time you are earning your high school
                diploma. Madison Academic Magnet High School prepares students to face the challenges
                of the best colleges in the country with all honor classes. And the latest addition to the high
                school system is Jackson Central Merry which functions as a medical technology magnet high
                school allowing you to get a head start on a career in the medical field. The expansion of the
                TCAT programs allows many students to enter the workforce as soon as they graduate with a
                marketable skill. Each of these schools helps the students to pursue the educational direction
                that suits everyone.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Jackson has long been known for its musical influence with the birth of Rockabilly
                music. This was a combination of the new Rock and Roll music coming from Memphis and the
                traditional country music coming from Nashville. Many famous musicians got their start here
                in Jackson and no one more famous than Carl Perkins. Carl had the respect of many rock and
                roll and country artists. Mrs. Fincher reminisced about artists visiting Carl to co-write songs.
                “Everyone would create rumors about who was here but usually it was not until the person
                had left town that a story would be featured in the local paper reporting who had been here.”
                People such as Dolly Parton and Paul McCarthy often visited Carl for several days at a time
                co-writing songs with him.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; For years, people have gone to the Hard Rock Café across the country, but few people
                know the first one in the United States started here in Jackson TN. in the mall. The restaurants
                were already famous in Europe when the two owners decided to compete to see who could
                open a café the quickest in the United States. Isaac Tigrett made a phone call to his mom who
                was developing Old Hickory Mall and within a matter of a few weeks, he had opened his café.
                Mrs. Fincher recalled when it first opened in the mall. “It was a small area near the main entrance. It
                started as a kiosk with a limited menu and has grown into a nationwide chain.” As
                the restaurants spread across the country, each developed a way to represent the unique history of its
                area. Jackson paints a place to grow for all desires and pursuits. With the expansion of
                the new arts district, Jackson is going to house many interests. This stretch will flood with color and
                expression from theatre to murals, and the music that fills the voices of Jackson. Jackson
                cultivates such art from the NED McWether Cultural arts Center, Lights Up! Theatre Co., the
                Carnegie documenting the rhythmic life of Jackson TN., the Ballet Arts, and the murals lining
                the walls of locally owned businesses. Lizzie Emmons with the Public Arts Commission calls
                this home for the arts a designated space “...within the City of Jackson that we are encouraging
                the continued creation of art making and art performing here,” said Lizzie Emmons, with the
                Public Arts Commission. “We are now sparking all of the creative ideas that are going to come
                from the artists and businesses that are already here,”. Jackson has taken leaps into recognizing the
                talents of neighbors, children, and family through their recognition of the arts.
                Jackson's blossom into a field of interest has opened the doors for people of all backgrounds.
                It has grown to become the home of artists, musicians, doctors, and many more. Diversity in
                Jackson has grown 11% since the 1980s. In response to cultural growth Jackson hosts an annual
                International Food and Arts festival. It allows people to come together, educate themselves,
                experience other cultures, and honor others. It features a parade, music, presentations, food,
                and dance to honor people's ethnicities. “The colors and the comradery are the most beautiful
                sights.” Mrs. Fincher commented. Since the beginning the festival has grown tremendously
                and in prep for the 7th annual IFAF it is exciting to experience the practices that unite us and
                take time to honor those around us.</p>
              <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; So, what defines Jackson? Is it a growing southern town parked in between two big cities,
                is it an education field that has adapted to the diverse minds of the students, or history in
                the arts? Jackson is a city that has changed much and only has room to grow. “I have watched
                Jackson change from a sleepy little southern town into a larger more diverse town” Mrs. Fincher ends.
                There are so many new projects expanding our community. Jackson is a place where
                you can find almost anything you are looking for- it's a place you can build a home.

                        An eternal winter lasts forever, they said <br>
                        When shines the sun, the grass is all dead <br>
                        But they never speak of evergreens, <br>

                        She needs not spring, only a moment in light <br>

                        Your weak light that you said you so hated <br>
                        Is the only love I’ve been demonstrated <br>
                        That didn’t come with pain, though it burned <br>

              <h2 class="title">Emotion is a Place</h2>
              <h3>Lily K. Lewis</h3>
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The house was embedded with bad memories, and it behaved as such. It was almost as if
                  the
                  house wanted its
                  inhabitants to know it was unhappy. There was an echo of fights and accusations. There were pipes full
                  of
                  frustrated tears and pillowcases stuffed with sleep-less nights. There were hopes and there were
                  dreams,
                  in that house, but they were hard to see when the blinds were always drawn, the lights were always
                  off,
                  the TV was always droning on. It was too quiet, and too loud all at once. With every step the floor
                  would
                  creak and shadows seemed deep and many. There was a kitchen, a living room, and a bathroom, like any
                  other house. There were a couple bedrooms, a few closets, and one attic. There was a front yard; there
                  was a backyard. There was a porch. But all of it, even in the light of day, shone dim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;The little boy who grew up here never saw his parents very much. They were always
                  busy doing something else. The house treated them coldly, and for some reason, they seemed
                  to fear it almost. However, the house, so bristly and cold, seemed warm and welcoming to
                  the boy who had never known kindness. So, he sat alone and made friends with this dark
                  creature, and he soon made a habit of hiding in dusty corners to talk to the house about
                  his day. The house, to the boy, seemed to respond in kind, and although it never really
                  answered, he spoke all the same. Many years passed, and nothing changed.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;And then one day, the boy turned eighteen. His parents, who hadn’t
                  spoken much to him before, called from downstairs that it was time to leave. The
                  boy (for he was not yet a man), begged and pleaded to remain with the house, the
                  house that had been his only friend. But he was denied and kicked out. Heartbroken
                  and sorrowful the boy walked onward, having no where to go. Every thought was of the house:
                  it was almost unbearable to leave it. He had never known anything but sorrow and fear and loneliness,
                  and he definitely didn’t know how to leave. This house, which he had learned to befriend, represented
                  the loneliness and fear he had lived in for so long. When he left that place, he finally realized
                  that there was so much more out there than the cold little world he had known. And so, he decided
                  to make his own house, one no one could take away from him, one where he could be happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;In his mind, he made a house of love and care, something he had never experienced.
                  It wasn’t a castle, it wasn’t a mansion, it was just a shack. But it was his and it was beautiful and
                  that was more than enough for him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;This shack was lovely in every way. The sun shone through open blinds every morning, and
                  there was a chair in the backyard just meant for looking at the stars. Everything was a perfect little
                  mess, not too neat, not too disorganized. A marvelous, controlled chaos. The door was always open to
                  anyone
                  who needed a place to rest and grow and love. There were no shadowy corners; there were no creaky
                  floors.
                  There was a soothing, peaceful quiet—the kind of silence where people heal--but there was so
                  much laughter, too. There wasn’t a screeching TV, just an open door. And although his old, cold house
                  sat across the way like an early memory, it didn’t taint the joy of his sunny shack because he chose
                  not to let it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;The old house became farther and farther from his thoughts. He learned how to love others
                  and how to make real friends and to be joyful. All that came from a choice. And although he once
                  believed
                  home was a place, he now knew it was a feeling, and he finally understood. Home is where you choose to
                  be, in your heart and soul, and what emotions you spend the most time cultivating in your mind. He
                  smiled
                  and knew everything would be okay. Love and joy was exactly where he wanted to be. And no one, no one
                  could ever take that away.

                  To most, home is a singular and physical place. <br>
                  It is a house with a roof and windows and doors and rooms, <br>
                  but the people who reside in it matter more. <br>
                  To them, home is a solid concept, <br>
                  a community full of comfort, reassurance, and joy. <br>
                  But I have many different homes <br>
                  With different moods and memories. <br>
                  My collective home is an amalgamation <br>
                  Of different places, stories, and memories, <br>
                  each with their own feelings and perspectives. <br>
                  I enter these homes of mine through sudden sensory. <br>
                  A taste of red velvet cake can take me to a home <br>
                  Full of cheer and laughter on my birthday, <br>
                  And yet the sound of breaking glass brings me to a home <br>
                  Full of discord in just a few seconds. <br>
                  This concept is fluid and everchanging <br>
                  To me, home is almost everywhere. <br>

                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; Once upon a time, there lived a happy little family on a happy little hill. They were
                  per- <br>
                  fect. Perfect car, perfect house. Perfect people. They lived happily ever after. The End. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; That’s how most stories go, right? I must be an outlier. My home is lack thereof. My
                  <br>
                  home is barely a home. Home is a four-letter word with millions of meanings and yet I still <br>
                  cannot find one for mine. I have searched for eighteen years, and I have to say, my eyes need <br>
                  to be checked. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; In the dark hours of midnight, my twisting and turning is a result of the overwhelming
                  <br>
                  steam engine of thoughts chugging through my head. 3 a. m. has a way of bringing out the <br>
                  anxieties buried during the day. My brain is a home for nestled thoughts. As I pull out my <br>
                  laptop and open YouTube, I mindlessly scroll, searching for a video to flood the racing brain. <br>
                  “New House Tour” flies up the page and my scrolling ceases. While I watch the pretty wife <br>
                  pan the camera around the elegant marble walls, the anxiety surfaces. <i>Why can’t my home be <br>
                    like this? What did I do in my past life to deserve less than nothing?</i> <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; As the hours tick by, the sun peaks its head out of the horizon. I sit on the porch with
                  a <br>
                  cup of coffee, hot steam blending with the morning dew. The chirp of the blackbirds snaps me <br>
                  into reality. The structural layout of the world around me is something only a God could con- <br>
                  struct. Maybe home is not so dreadful as the demons of midnight make me believe. Finishing <br>
                  off my last sips of coffee, my mother comes out of the door and sits on the porch with me. <br><br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; “You’re up early.” <br><br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; I jostled in my seat. <br><br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; “Never went to sleep.” <br><br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; This conversation repeats itself often. My insomnia enjoys playing games. <br><br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; With the sun settled in its place in the heavenly sky, my thoughts settled, too. My home
                  <br>
                  is not my home. My home is the stars in the sky and the grass on the ground. My home is the <br>

                  wrong. My home is the parents of my friend that make me feel like their own. My home is the <br>
                  beaten-up stop sign that resides on the end of my street. My home is my crazy family that hoot <br>
                  and holler at any given event. My home is around my home. And yeah, I don’t have a perfect <br>
                  house and a perfect family, but that definition simply does not fit in my meaning of of home. <br>

              <h3>Ashlyn Jones</h3>
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; Home is not a place. It’s not a person or a physical object. Home is a feeling. It’s the
                  <br>
                  validation you receive after getting a good grade on the paper you poured your heart and soul <br>
                  into. It’s the comfort yet disgust you feel when you see the crockpot sitting on the counter. It’s
                  <br>
                  the butterflies you get before pressing play on the new season of your favorite show. Home is <br>
                  the good, the bad, the sweet, and the sour. Home is where you feel complete and fragmented <br>
                  at the same time. It’s where you find solace in your imperfection. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; For me, literature provides the feeling of home. There’s something special about shar-
                  <br>
                  ing intensely personal experiences and finding a vast amount of people who relate. When <br>
                  you can’t find the words to express how you feel, it’s comforting knowing someone else has <br>
                  probably already found them for you. Pick up <i>It’s Kind of a Funny Story</i> by Ned Vizzini and <br>
                  you’ll find you’re not the only one who’s mental health suffers once they join an academically <br>
                  prestigious high school. You could check out <i>Eleanor & Park</i> by Rainbow Rowell and discover <br>
                  you’re not unaccompanied in your insecurity with body image. However you may feel, there <br>
                  is certainly a book that helps express those feelings. If there isn’t, you could be the one to write
                  it. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; Home does not have to be the house you come back to at the end of the day. Home in- <br>
                  cludes relief and relaxation, and for most people, those are not found in the place you go to af- <br>
                  ter school. Literature provides a form of escapism that allows individuals to teleport to another <br>
                  place. If one is feeling alone or misunderstood, venture to Northern Italy in <i>Call Me By Your <br>
                    Name</i> by André Aciman. Or, if you’re feeling held back by your anxiety, vacation to Australia
                  <br>
                  in <i>A Room Called Earth</i> by Madeleine Ryan. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; One shouldn’t let the intimidation of pre-existing art stop them from creating some-
                  <br>
                  thing beautiful themselves. Writing creates home. Some individuals favor buying a house, but <br>
                  some crave building it. I love creating a written piece where I feel I’ve used my creativity to <br>
                  make an impact or stir up an emotion. When someone writes— whether it be a story, poem, ar- <br>
                  ticle, etc.— it presents an opportunity to give a voice to the voiceless, to welcome them home. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; Literature offers not only an outlet, but an expression of self. It allows people to
                  com- <br>
                  municate as well as listen. It provides representation, comfort, and a way to clear your mind. <br>
                  Reading and writing provide a feeling of home to me. When things get difficult, I can always <br>
                  pick up a John Green novel and feel listened to. I know when I end up buying my own house, <br>
                  it won’t be complete without a library. Home is where the books are.

                  &nbsp; &nbsp; Forward Infront of me, the greyish slab of earth seemed to stretch on forever as the
                  seat <br>
                  I had been placed in proceeded forward until it reached a break, light in front of me blink- <br>
                  ing red. Cars of many different colors turned in-between the break in the slab trail, produc- <br>
                  ing quick loud <i>whooshing</i> sounds as they proceeded. It seemed like forever that I had been <br>
                  stopped there motionless as the colorful vehicles passed and I had begun to close my eyes <br>
                  tiredly when the light’s color again changed to green, and I was once again strolling down the <br>
                  greyish path ahead of me. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; The buildings surrounding me were tall and wide. Windows – which I had enjoyed <br>
                  looking out to the flowers from in my bedroom at home – filled nearly every inch of the struc- <br>
                  ture and I wondered if they too were looking at the flowers that filled the grass that was con- <br>
                  tained in the gray slab in the center of the quickly passing by vehicles. I was sure they were. <br>
                  The path in front of me was certainly not something I’d look at from a window. It was boring <br>
                  and colorless. It <i>must</i> be the flowers. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; A loud squall filled my ears but the people who walked along alongside me and my <br>
                  parents did not seem alarmed by this peculiar sound as it echoed through the tall structures <br>
                  around us. It was a sound I mostly heard on nights when wind shook the trees and loud cracks <br>
                  of light filled the sky. It was a scary sound. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; The people around me were as peculiar as the sounds themselves. Some walked past <br>
                  quickly, holding a square suitcase in their hand before walking to a stairwell that went un- <br>
                  derground. I had no idea where the underground staircase went but I imagined it must go <br>
                  to another part of the place. Maybe that place too had tall, windowed structures overlooking <br>
                  flowers. I thought it must, though I could not stretch my neck far enough to see any of it. Other <br>
                  people stood on the sides of the tall structures with shiny instruments in their hands, music <br>
                  filling the air around them. It was strange to think that my dad had grown up in such an odd <br>
                  place with such unusual places and people. It was vastly different from the quiet of home. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; As we continued the path over the large flag covered bridge, our pace slowed, and my
                  <br>
                  parents began to talk about the color of the river. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; “They dye the river green for St. Patrick’s Day,” said my dad as he looked down to me,
                  <br>
                  “Might be able to come back and see it sometime.” <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; But the water was already green. Its color was unlike any other water I’d seen which was
                  <br>
                  typically a blueish grey. Its color was just lighter than the trees that crowded around its sides <br>
                  below the bridge. I told my dad this and he laughed. The water could get greener. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; After my mother took a few pictures of the very green water, we moved forward and <br>
                  were once again sandwiched between the big, windowed buildings. What they could possibly <br>
                  need all of the large buildings for I did not know, but they stretched on for seemingly forever. <br>
                  We stopped at some of them as we went but even when we did there seemed to be no explana- <br>
                  tion for the height as most of the stores my mother wanted to stop in to look in did not tower to <br>
                  the sky as the buildings they were in did. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; The buildings stopped once again on the left side of the street for the park which was
                  ac- <br>
                  companied by a giant peanut. We did not stop at the giant peanut but continued past it and the <br>
                  green lions ahead of us – which I made an attempt to pet from my stroller – and turned down <br>
                  the street ahead of with trees, shrubs, and flowers completely replacing the large, towering <br>
                  buildings that had towered above me moments before. Ahead, water shot up in the air, creating <br>
                  a loud thundering sound as the airborne water fell back to the pool at its surface. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; The pool of water looked good for swimming but there was no one swimming or <br>
                  splashing in it and as we got closer, I saw that there had been a fence placed around it to pre- <br>
                  vent this. Quietly, I wondered if anyone had ever gotten past the fence and sat alongside the <br>
                  light blue-green horses that lay in the fountain’s water.
